# Javascript Developer test

One of our backend Ruby developers started working on a neat frontend for
swapi.org with some simple things:
* An index page with a list of the characters
* A character page with some basic information, including a list of
    movies that character was in
* A movie page with some basic info and a list of characters.

The pages that already have data, but are not yet stylized are the first
and second ones:
* List of characters
* Character detail page

## What you need to do:

Your tasks are to:
* Create the movie page
* Stylize everything according to the Zeplin project

You do not need to create an index page for listing all the movies. The
movies should be linked from the character details page. Each movie in the
character page should link to the appropriate movie.

Each character in the movie page should be linked to the appropriate
character.

We don't have images in the API, but considering there are only a few
movies, grab your favorite posters from Google Images and use them.

_Testing is also a requirement, so please test the components you create
or reuse._

## What we would really appreciate if you did:

* Test what was in the project before.
* There are some bugs in the app. It's up to you to find them and fix
    them.
* Having it deployed over to Heroku would be nice as well.

We are giving a two-week period to do this, but if you need more time
*do not hesitate to ask*.
