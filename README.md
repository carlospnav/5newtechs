# JavaScript Developer Test


One of our backend Ruby developers started working on a neat frontend for
[swapi.org](https://github.com/Helabs/swapi-graphql) with some simple things:
* An index page with a list of the characters
* A character page with some basic information, including a list of
    movies that character was in
* A movie page with some basic info and a list of characters.

The pages that already have data, but are not yet stylized are the first
and second ones:
* List of characters
* Character detail page

## What you need to do:

You should **fork this repo** and complete the following tasks:
* Add a search box to filter characters in the main page
* Create the movie page
* Stylize everything according to the Zeplin project

You do not need to create an index page for listing all the movies. The
movies should be linked from the character details page. Each movie in the
character page should link to the appropriate movie.

Each character in the movie page should be linked to the appropriate
character.

We don't have images in the API, but considering there are only a few
movies, grab your favorite posters from Google Images and use them.

_Testing is also a requirement, so please test the components you create
or reuse._

## What we would really appreciate if you did:

* Test what was in the project before.
* There are some bugs in the app. It's up to you to find them and fix
    them.
* Having it deployed over to Heroku would be nice as well.

You have a two-week period to do this, but if you need more time
*do not hesitate to ask*. When you are finished you don't need to submit a PR, just send us an email and we will analyze your fork.


Please, do not open pull requests nor create a public repository as your code becomes available to
other users. _If you open a pull-request or create a public repository your fork will be deleted and
you will be automatically disqualified._
