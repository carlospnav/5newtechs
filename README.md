# Javascript Developer test

Welcome to the Ignus Javascript developer test!

One of our backend Ruby developers started working on a neat frontend for
swapi.org with some simple things:
* An index page with a list of the characters
* A character page with some basic information, including a list of
    movies that character was in
* A movie page with some basic info and a list of characters.


## What you need to do:

So far, only the first and second pages have been created with no
styling whatsoever.

Your tasks are to:
* Create the movie page
* Stylize everything according to the Zeplin project

Each movie in the character page should link to the appropriate movie
and each character in the movie page should be linked to the appropriate
character.

_Testing is also a requirement, so please test the components you create
or reuse._

## What we would really appreciate if you did:

* Test what was in the project before.
* There are some bugs in the app. It's up to you to find them and fix
    them.
* Having it deployed over to Heroku would be nice as well.

We are giving a two-week period to do this, but if you need more time
*do not hesitate to ask*.
